# README Final Project CPSC333

### Project name: 
"What's the Vibe?" App

### Description: 
Have you ever wanted to find new music but didn’t know what you wanted to listen to? Sometimes it can be annoying to shuffle through random Spotify playlists 
just to find one song you might like and you would just prefer someone to pick something for you. “What’s the Vibe” streamlines this process by creating a fun and 
interactive way to find new music using a survey questionnaire to determine your mood, then recommending music based on that mood.

### Getting Started:
If you would like to use this app, as of right now, you can just clone the repository, and run it on Android Studio. There you can use the virtual device, and use the 
app to your benefit.

### Getting Help:
If you are having troubles with using our app, you can reach the authors at their emails that are provided.
